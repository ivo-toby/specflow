# Issues to be fixed

- [x] I have two specs in the project, but only the first is shown in the TUI
- [x] changes in the textareas should be saved, and warn a user that changes are unsaved when the textarea loses focus
- [x] the constition is not part of the workflow, nor the TUI. It should editable from the TUI
- [ ] I want the agents to be editable from the TUI
- [x] During ingestion Claude tends to create file with a lot of question. IF there's a questions.md file in the spec, add a tab that loads the file and allow the user to answer the questions. The ingest hook should be smart about this (eg. have claude code mention the possibility of answering in the file)
