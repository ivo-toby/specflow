- **Needs Testing** - Implemented but untested

---

## High Priority

### ~~1. AI Conflict Resolution (Tier 2 Merge)~~ COMPLETED

**File:** `src/specflow/orchestration/merge.py:51-254`
**Status:** Completed
**Description:** The `ConflictOnlyAIMerge` class now uses Claude Code to resolve git merge conflicts.

**Implementation:**
- Reads conflicted files with conflict markers
- Sends each file to Claude Code with a prompt explaining the conflict
- Claude outputs the resolved file content (no markers)
- Validates that no conflict markers remain
- Stages resolved files and commits the merge

**Key methods:**
- `_resolve_file_conflicts()`: Resolves a single file using AI
- `_run_claude_resolution()`: Runs Claude Code in headless mode

---

### ~~2. AI File Regeneration (Tier 3 Merge)~~ COMPLETED

**File:** `src/specflow/orchestration/merge.py:257-512`
**Status:** Completed
**Description:** The `FullFileAIMerge` class now regenerates conflicted files using Claude Code.

**Implementation:**
- Gets BOTH complete versions of each conflicted file using `git show branch:path`
- Sends both versions to Claude (no conflict markers)
- Claude intelligently merges both versions into a coherent file
- Handles edge cases (file exists in only one branch)
- Writes merged content and stages for commit

**Key difference from Tier 2:**
- Tier 2 works with conflict markers in a single file
- Tier 3 works with two separate complete file versions

**Key methods:**
- `_get_file_from_branch()`: Gets file content from a specific branch
- `_regenerate_file()`: Regenerates a single file using AI
- `_run_claude_regeneration()`: Runs Claude Code in headless mode

---

### ~~3. TUI New Spec Dialog~~ COMPLETED

**File:** `src/specflow/tui/widgets/new_spec_screen.py`
**Status:** Completed
**Description:** Modal dialog for creating new specifications.

**Implementation:**
- Created `NewSpecScreen` modal dialog
- Input fields: Spec ID, Title, Source Type (None/BRD/PRD)
- Validates required fields and checks for duplicates
- Creates spec in database with DRAFT status
- Creates spec directory with initial file (brd.md, prd.md, or spec.md)
- Auto-refreshes specs panel and loads new spec in editor

**Keybinding:** `Ctrl+N` to open dialog

---

### ~~4. TUI Help Screen~~ COMPLETED

**File:** `src/specflow/tui/widgets/help_screen.py`
**Status:** Completed
**Description:** Help screen with keyboard shortcuts and quick start guide.

**Implementation:**
- Created `HelpScreen` modal with scrollable Markdown content
- Keyboard shortcuts reference (navigation + actions)
- Quick start guide (5-step workflow)
- Workflow overview diagram
- Agent types reference
- CLI commands quick reference
- Link to GitHub documentation

**Keybinding:** `?` to open help screen

---

### ~~5. Agent-Created Follow-up Tasks~~ COMPLETED

**File:** `src/specflow/orchestration/execution.py:201-287`
**Status:** Completed
**Description:** Agents now create follow-up tasks when they encounter technical debt, placeholders, or improvement opportunities during implementation.

**Implementation:**
- Updated `_build_agent_prompt()` with follow-up task instructions for all agents
- Added `specflow task-followup` CLI command with metadata tracking
- Task metadata includes: `is_followup`, `category`, `parent_task`, `created_by_agent`
- TUI swimlanes show colored category badges for follow-up tasks
- TaskDetailModal displays parent task and category info

**Task Categories:**

| Prefix | Badge Color | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `PLACEHOLDER-` | Yellow (TODO) | Placeholder implementations |
| `TECH-DEBT-` | Red (DEBT) | Technical debt |
| `REFACTOR-` | Cyan (REFACTOR) | Refactoring opportunities |
| `TEST-GAP-` | Magenta (TEST) | Missing test coverage |
| `EDGE-CASE-` | Orange (EDGE) | Unhandled edge cases |
| `DOC-` | Blue (DOC) | Documentation gaps |

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
# Check existing tasks first
specflow list-tasks --spec my-feature --json

# Create follow-up task
specflow task-followup TECH-DEBT-001 my-feature "Refactor database pooling" \
    --parent TASK-005 \
    --priority 3 \
    --description "Add connection pooling to database module"
```

## Medium Priority

### 6. Cross-Session Memory System

**File:** `.specflow/memory/` directory
**Status:** Partial
**Description:** Directory structure exists but memory extraction/retrieval isn't implemented.

**Needed:**
- Entity extraction from conversations
- Memory persistence between sessions
- Context injection into agent prompts
- Memory search/retrieval

---

### 7. Parallel Task Execution

**File:** `src/specflow/orchestration/execution.py`
**Status:** Partial
**Description:** Tasks execute sequentially despite `max_parallel` setting.

**Current behavior:**
- Processes tasks one at a time in `cmd_execute`

**Needed:**
- Use `AgentPool` for concurrent execution
- Respect `max_parallel` limit
- Handle concurrent database updates

---

### 8. JSONL Sync for Git-Friendly Database

**File:** `src/specflow/core/sync.py` (if exists)
**Status:** Not Started
**Description:** README mentions JSONL sync but it's not implemented.

**Needed:**
- Export database to JSONL files
- Import from JSONL on project load
- Enable git-based collaboration on specs/tasks

---

## Low Priority

### 9. Agent Model Configuration

**File:** `.specflow/config.yaml`
**Status:** Partial
**Description:** Config supports model selection per agent but it's not used.

**Current behavior:**
- Config file has model settings
- Execution pipeline ignores them

**Needed:**
- Read model config in `ExecutionPipeline`
- Pass `--model` flag to Claude Code

---

### 10. Task Priority Queuing

**File:** `src/specflow/orchestration/agent_pool.py`
**Status:** Partial
**Description:** `AgentPool` exists but doesn't use priority for task ordering.

**Current behavior:**
- Tasks execute in order received

**Needed:**
- Sort tasks by priority before execution
- Priority 1 (high) executes before Priority 3 (low)

---

### 11. Execution Timeout Configuration

**File:** `src/specflow/orchestration/execution.py:74`
**Status:** Partial
**Description:** Timeout is hardcoded to 600 seconds.

**Current behavior:**
- `timeout: int = 600` is hardcoded

**Needed:**
- Read from config: `execution.timeout_minutes`
- Convert to seconds and pass to pipeline
